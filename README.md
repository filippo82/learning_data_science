## Online courses
### Machine and Deep Learning
* [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai)
* [Machine Learning](https://davidrosenberg.github.io/ml2018/#home)  
**Instructor**: David Rosenberg (NYU & Bloomberg)  
This course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning and statistical modeling. While mathematical methods and theoretical aspects will be covered, the primary goal is to provide students with the tools and principles needed to solve the data science problems found in practice. This course also serves as a foundation on which more specialized courses and further independent study can build.
